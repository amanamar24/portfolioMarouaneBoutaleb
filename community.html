              Hear why members of the ChooseVeg community went vegan or
              vegetarian, cut back on meat, or began eating more plant-based
              meals.
            </strong>
            I was raised and worked on livestock farms in Iowa, joined the
            Marine Corps at 19, and worked in some of the toughest neighborhoods
            in Washington, DC, for 25 years as a cop. Until I was 48 years old,
            the vast majority of my meals consisted of tons of meat, eggs, and
            dairy. Up until that point, given my upbringing and life
            experiences, I was convinced that I was eating all the right foods
            and on track to a healthy and long life. A couple of years prior, I
            lost my father to a heart attack at age 69, my older brother began
            having stents put in his heart, and my daughter decided to go vegan.
            And since I didn’t think eating a vegan diet was a healthy way to
            live, I dove in and read every nutritional book and health study I
            could find. You name it and I read it. What took me by complete
            surprise was the overwhelming amount of independent scientific
            research that supported a vegan diet. At first, I could hardly
            believe what I was reading. But study after study provided clear and
            convincing evidence that eating a vegan diet was by far the
            healthiest way to eat. Today I am 53 years old and have been vegan
            for almost five years. I weigh the same that I did when I joined the
            Marine Corps at 19 and feel better than I ever have! I love talking
            with folks and showing them how easy it is to eat a healthy vegan
            diet. I can’t think of anything more gratifying than helping someone
            lose weight and get off all their cholesterol and high blood
            pressure medicine within a few weeks on a vegan diet. The power of a
            plant-based diet is truly remarkable!
